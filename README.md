# Volatility Harvester

A production-grade BTC volatility harvesting trading engine with backtesting, paper trading, and live trading capabilities.

## Overview

The Volatility Harvester implements a systematic trading strategy that profits from Bitcoin's natural price oscillations by buying on dips and selling on rebounds. The system features:

- **Fee-aware execution** with maker/taker optimization
- **Full compounding** through all-in/all-out position management
- **Adaptive thresholds** based on market volatility (ATR)
- **Comprehensive risk management** with multiple circuit breakers
- **Multi-mode operation**: Backtest → Paper Trade → Live Trade pipeline

## Quick Start

### 1. Setup

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone <repo-url>
cd Volatility-Harvester

# Copy environment template
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env with your exchange API keys
nano .env
```

### 2. Start Services

```bash
# Start all services (Postgres, API, Prometheus, Grafana)
make up

# Wait for services to be ready (~30 seconds)
# API will be available at http://localhost:8000
```

### 3. Run Backtest

```bash
# Run backtest (requires historical data)
make backtest

# Or via API:
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/backtest \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "start_date": "2023-01-01T00:00:00",
    "end_date": "2023-12-31T23:59:59",
    "initial_capital": 10000,
    "buy_threshold_pct": 5.0,
    "sell_threshold_pct": 5.0
  }'
```

### 4. Paper Trade

```bash
# Start paper trading with simulated exchange
make paper

# Check status
make status

# Stop paper trading
make paper-stop
```

### 5. Live Trade (⚠️ REAL MONEY)

```bash
# ⚠️ WARNING: Live trading uses real money
# Ensure you have:
# 1. Tested thoroughly in paper mode
# 2. Configured risk limits appropriately
# 3. Set up API keys with appropriate permissions

make live

# Monitor status
make status

# Stop live trading
make live-stop

# Emergency flatten (sell all immediately)
make live-flatten
```

## Strategy

The Volatility Harvester uses swing thresholds to enter and exit positions:

- **Buy Trigger**: Price drops X% from recent peak (default 5%)
- **Sell Trigger**: Price rises Y% from entry (default 5%)
- **Adaptive Mode**: Thresholds adjust based on ATR
  - Low volatility (< 2.5%): Reduce thresholds
  - High volatility (> 6%): Increase thresholds

See [STRATEGY.md](docs/STRATEGY.md) for detailed strategy documentation.

## Risk Management

Multiple circuit breakers protect capital:

1. **Max Drawdown** (default 20%): Pause trading if drawdown exceeds limit
2. **Consecutive Losses** (default 5): Pause after multiple losing trades
3. **Daily Loss Limit** (default 10%): Stop trading if daily losses exceed threshold
4. **Volatility Bounds**: Pause if ATR too low (choppy) or too high (chaos)
5. **Spread Guard**: Block trades if spread too wide
6. **Latency Guard**: Pause if exchange data is stale

See [RISK.md](docs/RISK.md) for complete risk documentation.

## Configuration

Key parameters in `.env`:

```bash
# Strategy
BUY_THRESHOLD_PCT=5.0       # Buy dip threshold
SELL_THRESHOLD_PCT=5.0      # Sell rebound threshold
ADAPTIVE_THRESHOLDS=true    # Auto-adjust based on volatility
RESERVE_PCT=8.0             # Keep 8% cash in reserve

# Risk
MAX_DRAWDOWN_PCT=20.0       # Max drawdown before pause
MAX_CONSECUTIVE_LOSSES=5    # Max consecutive losses
MAX_SPREAD_BPS=10           # Max spread in basis points

# Execution
MAKER_FIRST=true            # Try limit orders first
MAKER_FEE_PCT=0.10          # 0.1% maker fee
TAKER_FEE_PCT=0.30          # 0.3% taker fee
```

## API Endpoints

- `GET /healthz` - Health check
- `GET /status` - Current trading status
- `GET /config` - Current configuration
- `GET /metrics` - Prometheus metrics
- `POST /start` - Start trading (paper or live)
- `POST /stop` - Stop trading
- `POST /backtest` - Run backtest
- `POST /emergency-flatten` - Emergency position exit

## Monitoring

### Prometheus Metrics

Available at `http://localhost:9090/metrics`:

- `volharvester_equity_usd` - Current total equity
- `volharvester_realized_pnl_usd` - Realized PnL
- `volharvester_unrealized_pnl_usd` - Unrealized PnL
- `volharvester_total_trades` - Total trade count

- `volharvester_paused` - Circuit breaker status

### Grafana Dashboards

1. Add Prometheus datasource: `http://prometheus:9090`
2. Import dashboards from `grafana/` directory
3. Monitor equity, PnL, trades, and risk metrics

## Development

```

## Backtesting

- Parameter sweeps
- Walk-forward analysis
- Performance metrics
- Result interpretation

## Safety & Best Practices

### Before Live Trading

1. ✅ Run extensive backtests on historical data
2. ✅ Paper trade for at least 1 week
3. ✅ Verify all circuit breakers trigger correctly
4. ✅ Test emergency flatten procedure
5. ✅ Start with small capital
6. ✅ Monitor closely for first 24 hours

### During Live Trading

- Monitor equity and PnL continuously
- Check for circuit breaker triggers
- Verify order fills and fees
- Watch for API rate limits
- Keep emergency flatten ready

### Never

- ❌ Trade more than you can afford to lose
- ❌ Disable circuit breakers
- ❌ Use production API keys in development
- ❌ Deploy without testing
- ❌ Leave unmonitored
